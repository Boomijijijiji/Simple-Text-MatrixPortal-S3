# Simple-Text-MatrixPortal-S3
Print text on your MatrixPortal S3 run RGB matrix. Easily input text, choose font type, and font color. 

As a novice it was a lot of trial/error in getting basic text with changeable characteristics to work on the 64x32 with 3mm pitch RGB display. There aren't many basic examples available using the MatrixPortal S3 with CircuitPython 9.0x and copying/pasting the code/libraries from Adafruit forums or Github still resulted in error/struggles; many examples on Adafruit/github use the M4 or are aged and use older versions of CircuitPython. 

This basic code produces three lines of text, and makes it clear/easy to replace the text, choose font, and change font colors.  

Instructions:
1) Extract the contents of the zip. This includes the code.py / lib / font files, 
2) Copy and paste these files onto your MatrixPortal S3's 'CIRCUITPY (X:)' drive.,
3) In MU, or some other editor, open the CODE.PY and review the INPUT hashtag notes for how to:
   A) Change the alphabet text,
   B) Change the font, and,
   3) change the color.
